# PCF-SignalR

This code was created initially for a session delivered at [PowerfulDevs Conf 2020](https://dev.to/azure/real-time-power-apps-with-signalr-13jk), and shows how to use the Power Apps Component Framework to enable real-time communication inside your Power Apps using Azure Functions and SignalR.

This code is "demo-tier"â€”meaning that there is no support, and there's almost certainly improvements to be made. For example: authentication has not been enabled for this demo; that should probably be your first stop.
